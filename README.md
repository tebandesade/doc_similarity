# doc_similarity
A Q/A, doc retriever 

This project aims to develop a program that's able to process some text (docs) and create a model out of it. 

Once the model is up, the program is able to accept new text as a query and get documents that are related to the query.

Description:
For the project two approaches are implemented (intend to do more). One is an implementation done taking advantage of gensims doc2vec model ("IA") and the other just building TFIDF (similar to Facebook's first part of DQRA). 

Note: It is not organized; it is in development (debug phase) and can't show something directly. If you want to see something, in the doc2vec add a path of files to path_, and change the input_ text.    

The data used for this will be Unity's documentation
TODO
